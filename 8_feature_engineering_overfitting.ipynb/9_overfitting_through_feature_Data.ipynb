    "### Understanding Overfitting Through Feature Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overfitting** occurs when a model learns the details and noise in its training data so well that it fails to make good predictions on unseen data. The model becomes “too fitted” to the specific examples in the training set, losing the ability to generalize broader patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To detect overfitting, one of the simplest and most effective tools is **cross-validation**. But before we get there, let’s start with a small example.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Experiment Setup (Vehicle Data Example)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have **vehicle data**—for example, engine power vs. fuel efficiency—with 35 data points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We fit **polynomial regression models** of increasing complexity (polynomial degree *k*). The goal: see how model complexity affects error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A helper function called `get_MSE_for_degree_k_model()`:\n",
    "- Builds a pipeline that creates polynomial features of degree *k*.\n",
    "- Fits a regression model to the training data.\n",
    "- Computes and returns **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\n",
    "from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_MSE_for_degree_k_model(X, y, k):\n",
    "    model = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(k), LinearRegression())\n",
    "    model.fit(X, y)\n",
    "    predictions = model.predict(X)\n",
    "    mse = mean_squared_error(y, predictions)\n",
    "    return mse\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For each degree `k`, we record the training MSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model Degree (k) | Training MSE |\n",
    "|------------------:|-------------:|\n",
    "| 0                | 72           |\n",
    "| 1                | 28           |\n",
    "| 2                | 15           |\n",
    "| 3                | 9            |\n",
    "| 4                | 6            |\n",
    "| 5                | 4            |\n",
    "| 6                | 2            |\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern is clear: as complexity increases, **training error decreases**.  \n",
    "However, that alone tells us nothing about whether our model generalizes well.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Visual Indicators of Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting different models reveals typical signs:\n",
    "- Degree 0: flat line → too simple (underfits)\n",
    "- Degree 1: straight line → somewhat fits\n",
    "- Degree 2: smooth curve → fits trend\n",
    "- Degree 6: very wiggly curve → fits noise (overfits)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the degree 6 model fits the original data almost perfectly, it performs **poorly on new points** (unseen “orange” data). The MSE for unseen data skyrockets, showing poor generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: The Need for Validation Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, we usually **don’t have future data** to test on. Instead, we simulate this by splitting our available data into **training** and **validation** sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Cross-Validation (Validation Split)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation enables us to estimate how well a model will generalize using **only existing data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split** your dataset into:\n",
    "   - **Training set**: used to fit model parameters.\n",
    "   - **Validation (development) set**: used to test already-trained models and compare performance across model types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shuffle before splitting**, to ensure truly random selections. Otherwise, if data follows an order (for example, low-to-high house prices), models won’t generalize properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Implementing a Basic Train-Validation Split\n",
    "\n",
    "Using sklearn utilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.utils import shuffle\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assume X, y are numpy arrays of shape (35, 1) and (35,)\n",
    "X, y = shuffle(X, y, random_state=42)  # randomize order\n",
    "X_train, X_val = np.split(X, [25])     # 25 for training, 10 for validation\n",
    "y_train, y_val = np.split(y, [25])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why shuffle? Because data might be sorted in ways that introduce bias.  \n",
    "For instance, if your dataset lists house prices from cheapest to priciest, the validation set would contain only high-priced homes — an unfair test for a model trained on low-priced ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Evaluating Training vs. Validation Error\n",
    "\n",
    "We fit models using **training data (25 points)** and check their **validation errors (10 points)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "train_errors, val_errors = [], []\n",
    "degrees = range(0, 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "for k in degrees:\n",
    "    model = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(k), LinearRegression())\n",
    "    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "    train_pred = model.predict(X_train)\n",
    "    val_pred = model.predict(X_val)\n",
    "\n",
    "    train_errors.append(mean_squared_error(y_train, train_pred))\n",
    "    val_errors.append(mean_squared_error(y_val, val_pred))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting training vs validation errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.plot(degrees, train_errors, label='Training Error', marker='o')\n",
    "plt.plot(degrees, val_errors, label='Validation Error', marker='o')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Model Degree')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Mean Squared Error')\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Interpreting the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "As degree (complexity) grows:\n",
    "- **Training error decreases continually** — complex models fit the training data better.\n",
    "- **Validation error forms a curve** — initially decreases (model fits better), then increases (model starts overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "At some optimal degree (say **degree 2**), validation error is minimal.  \n",
    "Choosing the model at this point gives the best balance of **bias** and **variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model Degree | Training MSE | Validation MSE |\n",
    "|--------------:|--------------:|----------------:|\n",
    "| 0 | 72 | 80 |\n",
    "| 1 | 28 | 30 |\n",
    "| 2 | 15 | **12** |\n",
    "| 3 | 9 | 14 |\n",
    "| 4 | 6 | 20 |\n",
    "| 5 | 4 | 35 |\n",
    "| 6 | 2 | 60 |\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Concept of Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hyperparameter** controls the *learning process itself*, not values learned by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Polynomial **degree** in polynomial regression.\n",
    "- **Max depth** in decision trees.\n",
    "- **Learning rate** in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We select hyperparameters using the **validation set**.  \n",
    "Parameters (like model coefficients) are learned from the training set; hyperparameters are tuned to optimize validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to **Google ML Crash Course**, hyperparameter tuning involves searching combinations (manual, grid, or random search) to find the best trade-off between underfitting and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Summary of Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Description | Python Tool |\n",
    "|---------|--------------|-------------|\n",
    "| Overfitting | Model learns noise, high variance | `PolynomialFeatures`, high degree |\n",
    "| Underfitting | Model too simple, high bias | Low-degree or linear regression |\n",
    "| Training set | Used to fit parameters | `fit()` method |\n",
    "| Validation/Dev set | Used to tune hyperparameters | separate `X_val`, `y_val` |\n",
    "| Cross-validation | Splitting data to estimate generalization | `train_test_split` or `KFold` |\n",
    "| Hyperparameter | Controls model complexity | `degree`, `C`, `max_depth`, etc. |\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going Beyond Simple Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical ML applications:\n",
    "- **K-Fold Cross-Validation** divides data into multiple folds (say 5). Each fold alternates as validation once while the others form training data.\n",
    "- This gives a more robust estimate of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example using scikit-learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "\n",
    "model = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(2), LinearRegression())\n",
    "scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error', cv=5)\n",
    "print(\"Average validation MSE:\", -np.mean(scores))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate synthetic data, simulate overfitting by varying model degree.\n",
    "2. Visualize training vs. validation error curves.\n",
    "3. Identify the degree that yields the lowest validation error.\n",
    "4. Confirm that higher complexity increases variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try experimenting with very high degrees to see numeric instability (rounding errors) — a fun insight noted in the lecture.\n",
