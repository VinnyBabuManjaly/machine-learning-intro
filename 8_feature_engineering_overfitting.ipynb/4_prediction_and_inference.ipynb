    "## Prediction vs. Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction and inference are two related but distinct goals in data modeling and machine learning, each with its own focus and purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prediction** is about using a model to forecast or estimate outcomes for new and unseen data points. The primary goal is **accuracy** in predicting future or unknown values. For instance, predicting the fuel efficiency of a new car given its horsepower. In this context, the model is mainly judged by how well it performs on these new inputs, not necessarily by understanding the underlying relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inference**, on the other hand, aims to **understand the true underlying relationships** between variables within the dataset. It tries to explain why and how predictor variables affect the response variable based on the data observed. For example, assessing how and why horsepower impacts fuel efficiency, taking into account economic or physical realities. Inference focuses on interpretability and causal understanding rather than just prediction accuracy.\n"

    "### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models are most reliable when making predictions **within the range of data they were trained on**. For example, both linear and quadratic (parabolic) regression models may make nonsensical predictions outside their training range (like negative fuel efficiency for very high horsepower). This limitation is normal and expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The choice between emphasizing inference or prediction depends on the problem at hand. If understanding causality or relationships is essential, focus on inference. If accuracy on new data matters more, focus on prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some models (like linear regression) are flexible enough to be used for both inference and prediction, but advanced models optimized for prediction (e.g., random forests, deep learning) often lack straightforward interpretability required for inference.\n"
