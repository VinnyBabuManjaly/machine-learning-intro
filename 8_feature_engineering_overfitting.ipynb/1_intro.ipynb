    "\n",
    "- Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training data too closely, including noise and irrelevant patterns, and consequently performs poorly on unseen, new data.\n",
    "- Overfitted models have high accuracy on training data but fail to generalize, often resulting from:\n",
    "  - Too complex models\n",
    "  - Small or insufficient training datasets\n",
    "  - Presence of noise or irrelevant features in the data\n",
    "  - Training the model for too many epochs.\n",
    "- This problem means the model memorizes rather than learns underlying trends, making it unreliable for practical prediction tasks.\n"

    "### Role of Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful and informative features that better capture the underlying patterns relevant to the prediction goal.[2]\n",
    "- Effective feature engineering improves both model accuracy and generalizability on new data:\n",
    "  - Techniques include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling or normalizing data, creating new features, and reducing dimensionality (e.g., via PCA).\n",
    "  - Ensuring features reflect domain knowledge and the core problem improves the likelihood that models learn genuine patterns rather than noise.\n",
    "- Thoughtful feature engineering often yields greater improvements than simply tweaking the modeling algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, data scientists counter overfitting by combining good modeling practices with strong feature engineering, ensuring that models generalize well to unseen data rather than simply memorizing their training sets.\n"
