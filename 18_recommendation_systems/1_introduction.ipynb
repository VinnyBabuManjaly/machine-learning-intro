    "A recommendation system is an ML-based system that predicts how much a user will like an item (often as a rating or relevance score) and then ranks items accordingly to show the most promising ones first. It is widely used for products, movies, music, news, and more to help users navigate large catalogs efficiently. [learnopencv](https://learnopencv.com/recommendation-system/)\n",

    "- It collects user–item interaction data such as ratings, clicks, views, likes, and purchases, plus item metadata like category, text, or tags. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/what-are-recommender-systems/)\n",
    "- It learns patterns that link users to items they tend to prefer, then predicts a score for unseen items and recommends the top-ranked ones. [nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/recommendation-system/)\n",
    "- Modern systems usually operate in stages: candidate generation (narrowing the catalog), scoring (assigning relevance), and re-ranking (adjusting for diversity, freshness, or business rules). [developers.google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/overview/types)\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Content-based filtering**: Recommends items similar to those the user liked in the past, based on item features (e.g., movie genre, keywords, textual description, or product attributes). [d2l](http://d2l.ai/chapter_recommender-systems/recsys-intro.html)\n",
    "- **Collaborative filtering**: Uses patterns in the user–item interaction matrix (who liked what) to recommend items that similar users liked or items that tend to be co-liked, without needing rich item metadata. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/what-are-recommender-systems/)\n",
    "- **Hybrid systems**: Combine collaborative and content-based (and sometimes contextual) signals to get better accuracy, handle cold-start cases, and improve robustness. [itransition](https://www.itransition.com/machine-learning/recommendation-systems)\n",
