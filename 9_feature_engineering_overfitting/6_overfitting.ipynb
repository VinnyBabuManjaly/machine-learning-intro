    "## Overfitting in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting happens when a model learns too much from its training data — not just the useful patterns that generalize to new data, but also the random noise or irrelevant details that exist only in that dataset. As a result, the model performs extremely well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, an overfit model “memorizes” the training examples instead of “understanding” the underlying relationships."

    "### Understanding the Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a model (like a regression or neural network), the algorithm tries to reduce the difference between predicted and actual values — called **error**.  \n",
    "We can measure this error in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training error:** How well the model fits the training data.  \n",
    "- **Test error:** How well the model performs on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal model keeps both low.  \n",
    "An overfit model, however, shows **low training error** but **high test error** — it fits the training data perfectly yet fails to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "As degree increases, the **training error decreases** because a more complex model can fit the training data more closely.  \n",
    "However, this comes at a cost: **the model becomes more sensitive** to minor changes in data.\n"

    "### Sensitivity and Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "High-degree models are **sensitive**: even moving one single data point slightly changes the curve dramatically.  \n",
    "This happens because a complex model has more “flexibility.” It can twist and bend to fit small variations—many of which are random noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sensitivity is called **high variance** — the model’s predictions fluctuate heavily with small changes in input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, simpler models (like degree 2) have **low variance**, meaning they’re more stable and generalize better."
