    "Time series data consists of data points indexed in temporal order, often at fixed intervals, and is used to analyze patterns such as trends, seasonality, and cycles over time. The distinct characteristics of time series data are its temporal dependence and sequential relationship, meaning each observation is typically influenced by past values (a property called autocorrelation or serial correlation)."

    "### Characteristics of Time Series Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporal Order:** Each data point corresponds to a specific timestamp; their sequence is fundamental for analysis.\n",
    "- **Regular or Irregular Intervals:** Data may be collected at consistent (e.g., hourly, daily) or irregular intervals (e.g., sporadic event logs).\n",
    "- **Temporal Dependence:** The value at one point in time is influenced by previous values—important for modeling and forecasting.\n",
    "- **Trend, Seasonality, Cyclicity, and Noise:** Time series often display long-term upward or downward movements (trend), repeating patterns (seasonality or cyclicity), and random variations (noise).\n",
    "- **Stationarity vs. Non-Stationarity:** Stationary series have constant statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation), while non-stationary series have properties that change over time, making them trickier to model directly."

    "### Types of Time Series Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Univariate Time Series:** Single variable tracked over time (e.g., daily closing stock price).\n",
    "- **Multivariate Time Series:** Multiple variables simultaneously recorded (e.g., environmental readings: temperature, humidity, wind speed).\n",
    "- **Regular Time Series:** Data at uniform intervals.\n",
    "- **Irregular Time Series:** Data at uneven intervals—common in event-based logging.\n",
    "- **Seasonal & Non-Seasonal:** Seasonal data exhibits predictable, regular patterns; non-seasonal does not.\n",
    "- **Cyclic Time Series:** Patterns that repeat but not at fixed periods, often tied to economic or business cycles.\n",
    "- **Noisy Time Series:** Dominated by randomness, obscuring patterns.\n",
    "- **Deterministic vs. Stochastic:** Deterministic series follow strict patterns (few in the real world), while stochastic series are shaped by randomness (e.g., real stock markets)."
