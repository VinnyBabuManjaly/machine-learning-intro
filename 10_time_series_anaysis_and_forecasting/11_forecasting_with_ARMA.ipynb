    "## Steps to Modeling and Forecasting with ARMA\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Check for Stationarity\n",
    "The first critical step is to check if the time series is stationary. ARMA models only apply to stationary data—meaning the series must have a consistent mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the series is non-stationary, it usually needs to be transformed (for example, by differencing) to become stationary before applying ARMA. This ensures the model assumptions are met, and meaningful parameters can be estimated."

    "### 2. Identify the Model Orders (p and q)\n",
    "Using the sample autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots, you identify the values of:\n",
    "- $p$: the order of the autoregressive (AR) component, representing how many past values your model will use\n",
    "- $q$: the order of the moving average (MA) component, representing how many past error terms the model will use\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the PACF cuts off after lag 1, it suggests an AR(1) model. If the ACF cuts off after lag 2, it suggests an MA(2) model."

    "### 3. Estimate Model Coefficients\n",
    "The next step is estimating the coefficients ($\\phi$ for AR and $\\theta$ for MA). This is done through an optimization process similar to linear regression that fits the model best to the observed data by minimizing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software libraries like the ARIMA class in statsmodels (Python) perform this parameter estimation automatically when you call the fit method on the model object."

    "### 4. Analyze Residuals\n",
    "After fitting, the residuals (differences between observed values and model predictions) are checked. Ideally, residuals should resemble white noise—random with no remaining pattern—indicating the model has captured all underlying structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the residuals still show structure, the model might be misspecified, or the data might be non-stationary or contain other behaviors not captured by ARMA."

    "### 5. Forecasting\n",
    "The fitted ARMA model can then be used to make forecasts. However, the forecasting horizon is often limited by the order $p$ and $q$ of the model; for example, an AR(1) model is typically only reliable for short-term predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term forecasts (e.g., years ahead) are challenging because ARMA captures only short-term dependencies and assumes stationarity."

    "## Example with Sunspot Data\n",
    "- The sunspots time series residue was checked, showing non-stationarity initially.\n",
    "- PACF suggested trying an AR(1) model.\n",
    "- The AR(1) model was built using ARIMA with order (1,0,0) (p=1, d=0, q=0).\n",
    "- Predictions closely followed the residue data in short steps.\n",
    "- The residuals from this ARMA model looked close to white noise, indicating the model captured structure well.\n",
    "- However, this limited AR(1) model cannot predict far into the future, which was a limitation for forecasting sunspots 15 years out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Notes\n",
    "- Differencing (the 'Integrated' part in ARIMA) is commonly used to convert non-stationary series to stationary.\n",
    "- The ARMA model assumes zero-mean for simplicity, so detrending and deseasonalizing data might be part of preprocessing.\n",
    "- Model diagnostics, including residual analysis and information criteria (AIC, BIC), help refine order choices.\n",
    "- ARMA models suit stationary time series and short-term forecasting; for longer horizons or non-stationary data, more advanced models (ARIMA, seasonal models, state-space models) may be necessary."
