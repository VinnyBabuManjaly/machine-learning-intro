    "### Generating Time Series Samples with ARMA Process\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) process models time series by combining dependencies on past values (AR) and past errors (MA).\n",
    "- Using `arma_process` in statsmodels, you create an ARMA process object by specifying AR and MA parameters (e.g., AR = [1, -0.8], MA = ).\n",
    "- Calling `generate_sample` on this object generates random samples (e.g., 100 data points), each sample differing due to randomness but governed by the specified process parameters.\n",
    "- Parameters must be chosen carefully to avoid instability; negative AR coefficients like -0.8 help ensure stability."

    "- Calling the **ACF** function on the ARMA process object returns the theoretical autocorrelation values for a specified number of lags.\n",
    "- The ACF typically starts at 1 for lag 0 and decays exponentially if the process is stationary.\n",
    "- This decay pattern or cut-off behavior helps identify stationarity in time series data."

    "\n",
    "- Monthly sunspots data is loaded and timestamps are converted for proper pandas indexing and plotting.\n",
    "- The sunspots count shows oscillations roughly every decade, indicating non-stationarity (statistical properties change over time).\n",
    "- Plotting sample ACF with many lags (e.g., 200) shows sinusoidal, non-decaying behavior, confirming non-stationarity.\n",
    "- To transform the data to approximate stationarity, the **difference** is computed (e.g., month-to-month differences), which removes long-term trends.\n",
    "- The ACF of differenced data shows a quick decay with only a few significant lags, a hallmark of stationarity."
