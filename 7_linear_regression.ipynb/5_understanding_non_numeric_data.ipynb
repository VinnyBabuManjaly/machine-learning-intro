    "  - Examples: Gender (male, female, nonbinary), eye color (brown, blue, green), countries, animal species.\n",
    "  - Sometimes coded with numbers (e.g., 1=male, 2=female), but these numbers have no arithmetic meaning.\n",
    "- **Typical Usage**: Often collected in surveys or forms as free-form answers, radio buttons, or multiple-choice groups.\n",
    "- **Analysis**: Frequency counts, mode, visualization with pie charts and bar charts."

    "  - Categories have a logical order (e.g., low < medium < high)\n",
    "  - No quantifiable distance between categories\n",
    "  - Examples: Customer satisfaction (low, medium, high), education level (elementary, high school, college), race placement (1st, 2nd, 3rd).\n",
    "- **Typical Usage**: Commonly used in ratings, rankings, feedback forms, bug severity levels (e.g., minor, major, critical).\n",
    "- **Analysis**: Median, percentiles, ranking tests, ordinal regression, visuals with ordered bar charts."

    "- **Ordinal data sometimes assigned numeric codes**: These should only be used for ordering, not arithmetic calculations.\n",
    "- **Survey Insights**:\n",
    "  - Nominal questions allow respondents to express unique, unranked categories.\n",
    "  - Ordinal questions restrict responses to predefined ordered options, enabling concise and targeted analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nominal and ordinal data are foundational for exploratory data analysis, helping data scientists understand, classify, and organize information. Nominal data focuses on pure categories with no order, whereas ordinal data involves a meaningful order but undefined interval spacing. Recognizing the difference safeguards against incorrect conclusions and ensures the right statistical approach in machine learning projects."
