    "## Understanding the Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear vs. Nonlinear Features\n",
    "\n",
    "A **linear model** (like Linear Regression) assumes the target variable changes linearly with input features. However, many real-world relationships are **nonlinear**.  \n",
    "To handle this, we can **generate nonlinear features** from existing ones — transforming input data into a higher-dimensional space where linear models can better capture complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of nonlinear transformations:\n",
    "- Polynomial features (e.g., x², x³)\n",
    "- Interaction terms (e.g., x₁ × x₂)\n",
    "- Logarithmic or exponential transformations\n",
    "- Sinusoidal transformations (useful for periodic data)\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "- Linear models: simple, interpretable, low variance  \n",
    "- Nonlinear feature transformations: increase flexibility, may raise variance\n",

    "### Inference vs. Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "| Objective | Inference | Prediction |\n",
    "|------------|------------|-------------|\n",
    "| Goal | Understand relationships between features and target | Forecast new outcomes |\n",
    "| Example Question | “How does house size affect price?” | “What will this house sell for?” |\n",
    "| Model preference | Simple, interpretable models | Models with best predictive accuracy |\n",
    "| Evaluation focus | Statistical significance, coefficients | Error metrics (MSE, MAE, R²) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between inference and prediction determines how complex or interpretable the final model should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Error vs. Model Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Error**: The difference between the model’s predictions and actual outputs on the training data.  \n",
    "- **Model Complexity**: How flexible the model is; higher complexity fits data more closely but risks **overfitting**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Typical pattern:\n",
    "- Low complexity → underfitting → high training and validation errors  \n",
    "- Moderate complexity → good generalization  \n",
    "- High complexity → overfitting → low training error, high validation error  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal: find the “sweet spot” of minimum **validation error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity to Dataset Splits\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of a model can vary if trained on different subsets of data due to randomness in sampling.  \n",
    "To ensure robustness:\n",
    "- Use multiple random splits (cross-validation).  \n",
    "- Observe variation in validation scores.  \n",
    "- Keep the **test set** untouched until final evaluation.\n",

    "- **Nonlinear features** empower simple linear models to handle complex patterns.  \n",
