    "### Introduction: Understanding Model Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models are built to make predictions. The quality of those predictions depends on how well the model captures the true patterns in the data without learning noise or irrelevant details.  \n",
    "To judge that, we look at **error**, the difference between what the model predicts and what actually happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of error components in any machine learning model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Irreducible Error:** The part of the error that no model can remove.  \n",
    "2. **Reducible Error:** The part that can be improved with better modeling or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these define the limits of model performance."

    "\n",
    "Irreducible error is a form of noise present in all real-world data. It’s caused by unpredictable or unmeasured factors that a model simply cannot account for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common sources of irreducible error:\n",
    "- **Noise in data collection:** For example, sensor inaccuracies, typing mistakes, or random recording errors.\n",
    "- **Missing or unobserved variables:** The model might be missing key variables—for instance, student stress levels when predicting exam scores.\n",
    "- **Inherent randomness in data:** Some phenomena (like human decisions or weather) have built-in unpredictability.\n",
    "- **Model approximation:** Real-world processes are often too complex to fully capture mathematically or algorithmically.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how advanced an algorithm is, it cannot eliminate irreducible error. Recognizing this sets realistic expectations for model accuracy.\n",

    "Key characteristics of high bias:\n",
    "- The model ignores complexity.  \n",
    "- It performs poorly on both training and test data.  \n",
