    "## Model Fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model fitting in machine learning means finding a mathematical equation that best describes the relationship between input data (features) and target outputs (labels).\n",
    "- In regression tasks, the goal is to predict a continuous value, such as estimating miles per gallon based on engine horsepower.\n"

    "### Linear vs. Nonlinear Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Models:** These models predict the output by combining features with fixed weights. The prediction is a straight line when plotting input vs. output.\n",
    "  - Example: If you have three features, the equation looks like: prediction = weight1 × feature1 + weight2 × feature2 + weight3 × feature3 + intercept.\n",
    "  - Limitation: Linear models can only capture relationships that look like straight lines. They can’t model curves or complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Challenge:** Real-world data isn’t always linear. For example, the relationship between vehicle horsepower and fuel efficiency is curved — larger engines mean lower efficiency, but not in a simple straight-line way.\n"

    "### Parabolic (Quadratic) Model Fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "- A parabola is a U-shaped curve, and fitting a parabolic model means using a mathematical equation that describes this curve.\n",
    "- Instead of just combining features, a parabolic (or quadratic) model uses squared features too. That means it can model relationships that curve or arc.\n",
    "- Example: To fit a curve to data, pick two points on the curve (like the minimum and another point) to guess the parabola’s equation. This gives better predictions than a line when the relationship in data is truly curved.\n",
    "- Comparing models:\n",
    "  - Simple linear regression fails to follow the curved pattern, resulting in higher error.\n",
    "  - Parabolic fitting (y = ax² + bx + c) captures the curve, reducing prediction error.\n"

    "### Adding Nonlinear Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of creating a whole new modeling method, you can simply add a new feature: the square of your original feature.\n",
    "  - Example: For each car, calculate “horsepower squared” and use it as an extra feature in your regression model.\n",
    "- Linear regression can then use both the original and squared features to produce a curved fit, even though the algorithm itself is still “linear” in the sense of combining features with weights.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare data:** Collect your input and output values. For vehicles, input is horsepower, output is miles per gallon.\n",
    "2. **Plot data:** Visualize the data to see its shape—if it looks curved, parabolic models are a good choice.\n",
    "3. **Feature engineering:** Create extra columns in your data, such as horsepower squared.\n",
    "4. **Model training:** Use the same linear regression tool, but train it with both features (horsepower and horsepower squared).\n",
    "5. **Compare fits:** Check model errors. Parabolic fit should have lower error than simple linear fit if the true pattern is curved.\n"

    "### Why Does This Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Capturing the True Trend:** Adding squared features lets your regression model flexibly capture the real pattern in the data. This avoids \"underfitting\" (too simple a model).\n",
    "- **Avoiding Tricks:** No special “quadratic regression” tool needed; just create the right features, and your regular linear regression technique can handle it.\n",
    "- **General Approach:** This same method works for any nonlinear relationship—experiment with higher powers, or interactions between features.\n"

    "\n",
    "- Linear models are simple but can be too limited if data shows curves.\n",
    "- Adding nonlinear features (squared terms) lets you fit curved relationships using existing tools.\n",
    "- Parabolic fitting improves predictions when the pattern in data isn’t a straight line.\n",
    "- Good model fitting means balancing between underfitting (too simple) and overfitting (too complex or too tailored to training data).\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are foundational for understanding both the limitations and the flexibility of regression models in real-world machine learning problems."
