    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to interpret, understand, and generate human language. It has two main subfields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**  \n",
    "  Involves analyzing text to derive meaning and intent based on its syntax and semantics.  \n",
    "  *Example:* Detecting whether a review is positive or negative by understanding sentence structure and word meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Generation (NLG):**  \n",
    "  Involves producing natural-sounding language from structured data (and sometimes adding speech synthesis).  \n",
    "  *Example:* ChatGPT generating text replies or automated news writing."

    "Why NLP is challenging and distinct from traditional, number-based machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Word Order Matters:**  \n",
    "   The sequence of words affects meaning (e.g., *“I cleaned my car”* vs. *“I had my car cleaned”*).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Word Meaning Depends on Context:**  \n",
    "   Words like *“bark”* change meaning depending on the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Human Language Is Imprecise:**  \n",
    "   Language includes ambiguity, idioms, typos, and personalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications** include:\n",
    "- Search engines (query understanding)\n",
    "- Spam detection\n",
    "- Machine translation (Google Translate)\n",
    "- Dialogue systems and chatbots\n",
    "- Text summarization and categorization\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis (e.g., movie or tweet opinions)\n",
    "- Speech recognition (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow comparison with ML:**\n",
    "- Data in NLP is called a *corpus*, and each sample is a *document* (review, article, tweet, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Similar ML workflow applies—split data, preprocess, extract features, train, and evaluate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key NLP-specific steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Tokenization:** Split text into words or units.\n",
    "  - **Normalization:** Convert tokens to a standard form (e.g., lowercase, removing punctuation).\n",
    "  - **Feature extraction:** Convert text into numbers using approaches like *bag-of-words* or *TF‑IDF*."

    "- **Text Classification & Sentiment Analysis:** Spam detection, customer review analysis.\n",
    "- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying names, locations, or organizations in text.\n",
    "- **Machine Translation:** Cross-language translation (e.g., Google Translate).\n",
    "- **Speech Recognition & Voice Assistants:** Converting speech ↔ text for systems like Alexa or Siri.\n",
    "- **Text Generation:** Producing meaningful text from prompts (e.g., chatbots, storytelling apps).\n",
