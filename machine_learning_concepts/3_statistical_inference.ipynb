    "# Statistical Inference  \n",
    "Statistical inference is the process of using a **small sample of data** to learn about or make decisions regarding a much larger group called the **population**. Since it’s often impossible or impractical to study everyone in the population, we use the sample to guess what the whole group might be like.  "

    "**Descriptive statistics** summarize and describe the data you have.  \n",

    "**Inferential statistics** go beyond your handful of apples and help you make predictions or conclusions about all the apples in the entire orchard.  \n",
    " \n",
    "- Analogy: From your handful, you estimate that about 60% of all apples in the orchard are red. You’re inferring orchard-wide info from the small sample.  "

    "You start with two opposing ideas (hypotheses):\n",

    "**Significance Level (α)**: The threshold for deciding if you have strong enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  \n",
    "Common values are 0.05 (5% chance you are wrong), 0.01, or 0.1.  \n",
    "Analogy: It’s like setting a rule that if you see apples bigger than usual in 95 out of 100 samples, you’ll believe the fertilizer really worked.\n",
