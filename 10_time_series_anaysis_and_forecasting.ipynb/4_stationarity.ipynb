    "## Stationarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationarity is a fundamental concept in time series analysis. A stationary time series has statistical properties—mean, variance, and autocovariance—that remain constant over time, and lacks trends or seasonal effects. Stationarity makes such datasets much easier to model, and many time series models assume data is stationary for reliable performance."

    "- **Definition:** Mean, variance, and autocovariance do not change over time.\n",
    "- **Characteristics:** No observable trends or seasonality; the statistical behavior looks similar regardless of when observations are recorded.\n",
    "- **Importance:** Most classical statistical models (e.g., ARMA, ARIMA) rely on stationarity for accurate forecasting and analysis."

    "- **Characteristics:** Displays trends, seasonality, or other time-dependent structures, making statistical conclusions less reliable.\n",
    "- **Common in Practice:** Financial datasets, sales figures, and many real-world time series are typically non-stationary."

    "### Transforming to Stationarity: Differencing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Differencing eliminates changes in the level (trend or seasonality) of the time series, creating a stationary series suitable for modeling.\n",
    "- **Method:** Each data point is replaced by the difference between itself and the previous observation: \\(y'_t = y_t - y_{t-1}\\).\n",
    "- **Practical Steps:** Visualize the time series, look for trends or seasonality, and apply differencing until the series behaves stationarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationarity is critical for time series analysis, and transforming non-stationary data through differencing or other techniques allows you to leverage accurate and robust statistical models for forecasting."
