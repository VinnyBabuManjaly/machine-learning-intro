    "## **Introduction to Clustering and K-Means**\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is one of the most fundamental unsupervised learning techniques in machine learning. Unlike supervised learning, it does not rely on labeled data. Instead, clustering algorithms analyze data to find natural groupings or patterns among rows (samples) of a dataset. The most popular method for clustering is k-means clustering, which offers a simple yet powerful way to uncover structure in data."

    "\n",
    "Clustering is the process of **grouping data points** so that points in the same group (called a *cluster*) are more similar to each other than to points in different clusters. It helps us reveal hidden patterns, relationships, and structure within data — even when we don’t know what those patterns might be."

    "(a) **Inertia and Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm tries to minimize the total distance between points and their corresponding cluster centroids. This total distance is called **inertia**. Lower inertia means the clusters are tighter and better defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) **The Role of Random Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because initial centroids are chosen randomly, different starting points may lead to different final cluster solutions. To counter this, **k-means is typically run multiple times** with different random starts, and the result with the **lowest inertia** is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) **Choosing the Value of K (Number of Clusters)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the number of clusters *k* is an important design decision. One commonly used approach is the **elbow method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the k-means algorithm for several values of *k* (e.g., 1 to 10).\n",
    "- Plot the inertia (sum of squared distances) for each *k*.\n",
    "- The plot often shows a sharp bend or “elbow.” The **optimal k** is typically near this bend, where the improvement in inertia begins to level off."
