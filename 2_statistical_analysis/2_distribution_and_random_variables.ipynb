    "1. The Problem: A System That‚Äôs Not Predictable\n",
    "Imagine you have a \"mystery box.\" Each time you look at it (or sample from it), it gives a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weird part: you don‚Äôt always get the same number. Sometimes it‚Äôs 3, sometimes 7, sometimes -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a system always gives the same result for the same input, it‚Äôs deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this box is not deterministic ‚Üí it gives different numbers each time, even with no inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ This is where probability comes in, because probability helps us describe and understand randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modeling Randomness with Probability Distributions\n",
    "Instead of trying to predict exactly what number will come out, we model the likelihood of possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a Probability Distribution to describe:\n",
    "\n",
    "Which values might appear\n",
    "\n",
    "How likely each value is\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete Distributions ‚Äì outcomes are separate, countable items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: coin toss (heads or tails).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can directly say P(heads) = 0.4, P(tails) = 0.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each distinct outcome has a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Distributions ‚Äì outcomes can be any number within a range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: people‚Äôs heights. A person isn‚Äôt exactly 160.000000 cm; they might be 160.3 cm, 161.8 cm, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are infinite possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, instead of asking ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the probability someone is exactly 160 cm tall?‚Äù (which would be essentially zero), we ask ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the probability someone‚Äôs height is between 160 and 165 cm?‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "A PDF (probability density function) is the curve or function that describes the distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete cases, the probability is written directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous cases, we calculate probabilities by finding the area under the curve between two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses calculus (integrals):\n",
    "\n",
    "Area under the curve = probability that the outcome falls within that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Example: The probability that a person's height is between 160‚Äì165 cm = the integral of the PDF between 160 and 165.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Notation\n",
    "Probability is usually written with a big P. Example: P(heads) = 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability density function itself is written with a small p. Example: p(y) means the density at value y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables are typically written with capital letters (Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "Actual observed values (samples) are written with lowercase letters (y).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Y = the random variable describing \"height.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "y = an observed sampled value, e.g. person‚Äôs height = 162.3 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Random Variable\n",
    "A random variable is just a variable whose value is not fixed but changes when sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs not random in the \"illogical\" sense ‚Äî it‚Äôs governed by a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Roll a die ‚Üí random variable X = the outcome (1‚Äì6).\n",
    "\n",
    "Toss a coin ‚Üí random variable C = (heads or tails).\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually write:\n",
    "\n",
    "Y ~ p(y) ‚Üí means random variable Y is distributed according to distribution p(y).\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset of size n = a collection of n samples of the random variable. Example: y1, y2, ‚Ä¶, yn.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Connecting It All Together\n",
    "Let‚Äôs tie this with the \"mystery box\" example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time we sample the box, we get unpredictable numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this, we assume the outputs come from some distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "By collecting many samples, we try to figure out what that distribution looks like (normal, uniform, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the distribution, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimate probabilities (e.g., \"How likely is the box to give a number between 10 and 15?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand whether outcomes are discrete (like dice rolls) or continuous (like human height).\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Beginner Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability distributions are ways to describe randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete = separate values (coin toss, dice).\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous = any value within a range (heights, weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilities for continuous outcomes are computed over intervals, not exact single points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables are the \"mathematical names\" for these unpredictable quantities."
