    "### What Is a Histogram?\n",
    "A *histogram* is a type of bar plot that shows the frequency distribution of a single numerical variable by grouping the data points into bins (intervals) and plotting how many data points fall into each bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The x-axis represents the bins (ranges of values).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The y-axis represents the count (or frequency) of data points per bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization helps us quickly grasp the shape and characteristics of data."

    "\n",
    "**Distribution Shape**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether data is symmetric (like the classic bell-shaped normal distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the data clusters around a central value or is spread out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skewness**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If one tail of the data is longer (skewed left or right), which means the data is not symmetrical.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This skewness affects statistical modeling and sometimes calls for data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Histograms highlight rare or extreme values that fall far from the main data cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outliers require investigation and sometimes data cleaning or transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes histograms vital during exploratory data analysis (EDA) before deeper modeling or inference."
