    "## Regularization\n",
    "Regularization in machine learning is a technique to optimize models by controlling model complexity and preventing overfitting or underfitting. It achieves this by adding a penalty term to the original loss function, penalizing large model parameters (weights) to keep the model simpler and more generalizable."

    "### Types of Regularization: Ridge (L2) and LASSO (L1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ridge Regularization (L2)**: Uses the L2 norm of the weight vector, which is the sum of the squares of the weights. The loss function minimized is the original error plus a penalty term proportional to the squared magnitude of the coefficients:  \n",

    "  Here, $\\alpha$ is the regularization strength controlling how much to shrink the coefficients. Ridge regression shrinks coefficients towards zero but does not set them exactly to zero, thus retaining all features but reducing their impact. It helps control multicollinearity and reduces overfitting by simplifying the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\alpha$ controls model complexity:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Small $\\alpha$ means weak regularization and a complex model closer to standard linear regression (weights are larger). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Large $\\alpha$ means strong regularization, shrinking weights towards zero and resulting in a simpler model that uses features less aggressively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As $\\alpha$ increases, the sum of squares of weights decreases, reducing the model's expressiveness and training error generally increases due to reduced overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship can be visualized by plotting training mean squared error against $\\alpha$ or its inverse. Training error decreases as regularization weakens (small $\\alpha$) and increases with strong regularization (large $\\alpha$). Unlike polynomial model complexity jumps, $\\alpha$ offers a smooth control over complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition Behind Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization constrains the size of model coefficients so that the model is less sensitive to the noise and variance in the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression can be seen as minimizing residual sum of squares with an added constraint on the L2 norm of coefficients, geometrically represented by a circular constraint space—the coefficients shrink as the constraint tightens."
