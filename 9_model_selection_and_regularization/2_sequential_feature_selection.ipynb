    "\n",
    "Sequential feature selection is a method for **automating the process of choosing the best subset of features** (columns or variables) from a larger set. This technique helps find a smaller group of features that improves model performance without having to try every possible combination, which can be computationally impossible on larger datasets.\n"

    "### Why Do We Need Sequential Feature Selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In machine learning, having too many features (inputs) can cause the model to **overfit**—it memorizes the training data but performs poorly on unseen data.\n",
    "- For example, a model built with 55 polynomial features might have very low training error (it fits the training data well) but has high error on validation or new data, indicating overfitting.\n",
    "- Exhaustively testing every combination of those 55 features (2^55 possible models) to find the best subset would take an extremely long time, even on powerful computers.\n",
    "- **Sequential feature selection finds good features without needing to test every possible combination.**"

    "\n",
    "1. **Start:** \n",
    "   - No features are selected initially (an empty set).\n",
    "   - All features are candidates for selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iteration 1 - Adding the First Feature:**\n",
    "   - Try each candidate feature individually.\n",
    "   - Fit a model with that single feature.\n",
    "   - Compute the **development (or validation) set error** for each model.\n",
    "   - Select the feature that results in the *lowest* error.\n",
    "   - This feature is added permanently to the selected set (called phi_selected).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iteration 2 - Adding Subsequent Features:**\n",
    "   - Now take the already selected feature(s).\n",
    "   - For each remaining candidate feature (phi_remaining), fit a model that uses all selected features plus the new candidate.\n",
    "   - Compute the development set error for each model.\n",
    "   - Select the candidate that improves performance the most (lowest error).\n",
    "   - Add this feature permanently to phi_selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat** the above step until the desired number of features is selected."

    "- Once selected, features remain **permanently in the set**.\n",
    "- The method **only fits a limited number of models** during the search, drastically reducing computational cost compared to testing all combinations.\n",
